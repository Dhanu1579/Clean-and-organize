## ⚙️ Data Preparation Workflow

### **1️⃣ Load & Clean Data**
- Removed ₹ and commas from funding amounts  
- Standardized column names to lowercase with underscores  
- Extracted numeric values for analysis  
- Added a new column `funded_flag` → *True/False* for whether the startup received a deal  

### **2️⃣ Analyze by Domain (Industry)**
Grouped startups by `industry` to calculate:
- Total number of startups  
- Number of funded startups  
- Total and average deal amounts  

### **3️⃣ Analyze Founder Profiles**
Grouped by `number_of_presenters` to compute:
- Total startups per team size  
- Funded startups per team size  
- Success rate = `(funded / total) * 100`

### **4️⃣ Export for Tableau Visualization**
Exported 3 clean CSV files for Tableau:
- **Cleaned_SharkTank_Main.csv** → full dataset  
- **Tableau_Industry_Summary.csv** → industry-level data  
- **Tableau_Founder_Success.csv** → founder success rates
